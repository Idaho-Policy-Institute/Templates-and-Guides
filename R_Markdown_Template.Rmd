## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r penguins}
summary(penguins)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(penguins)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here's an example of how to use tabs to explore different themes:

## Penguin Measurements {.tabset}
Here are some basic descriptive graphs of the penguins included in the palmer penguins dataset, arranged by species and sex.

### Body Mass

Overall, Gentoo penguins tend to be *heaviest*. However, penguins are sexually dimorphic, so males are usually heavier than females, regardless of species.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = sex)) +
  theme_light()
```

### Flipper Length

As the largest species, Gentoo also have the longest flippers.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, fill = sex)) +
    theme_light()
```

### Bill Dimensions

Despite being heavier, and having longer flippers, Gentoos do **not** tend to have any longer beaks than Chinstraps,and they tend to have shallower beaks than Adelies.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(!is.na(sex)) %>%
 ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
    facet_wrap(.~sex) +
    theme_light() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
    
```

##  Another Heading
I can also include tables in the document:
```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(!is.na(sex)) %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarize(Average_Weight_in_Grams = mean(body_mass_g)) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = "lcc", caption = "Table 1: Average Penguin Weights by Species and Sex") %>%
  kable_minimal(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  row_spec(1:2, color = "blue") %>%
  row_spec(3:4, color = "green") %>%
  row_spec(5:6, color = "purple")#The kable family of functions lets us build tables in html format.
  
```
